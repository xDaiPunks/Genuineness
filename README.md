### Verifying the Punks are 100% Authentic and Legit xDaiPunks

![All the CryptoPunks](/punks.png)

This is the official and genuine image of all of the xDaiPunks that have been created. To allow verification that the punks being managed by the xDaiPunks xDai contract are the same as what you see in the image, we have embedded a SHA256 hash of the image file into the contract. You can generate this hash for the punks image file via a command line similar to ```openssl sha256 punks.png``` and compare that to the embedded hash in the contract ```3a58fa9631cae5b7043680252a9e6e3e4509caf4b14debd714f941a36240f009```.
